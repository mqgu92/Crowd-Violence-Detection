Mathworks do no allow precompiled binaries in the submissions, therefore the videoinput library is not here. To get this working, get the library from:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/videoinput-mex/

put all the binaries in the current folder(where u found this text file).

The two files:

vi_get_pixelsProper.m,
vi_setup_deviceProper.m

should also be in this folder.

Alternatively, there will be a downloadable version of this submission, all encompassing from my webpage:
