v 1.01:

- the method 'LKimproved' has been renamed "flow1"
- method "flow1full" is added, which is the same as "flow1" but calculated in dedicated m-file, and generates hi-res output
- color coding of flow directions implemented using HSV color space
- added pause function, keyboard interface, hit 'p' to toggle.
- added framerate control. The application now has a target framerate of 25 frames/second. This will make application execution similar on all systems.
- fixed a bug that stopped the videoInput library from working.
- pdf has been improved, and extended. 
- the path to 'helperFunctions' is not setup up properly on both windows and other systems(didnt work for linux)
- The minimum lag time has been increased, so it wont crash on slower linux systems.
